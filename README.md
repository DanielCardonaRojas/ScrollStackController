# ScrollStackController
Create complex scrollable layout using UIViewController and simplify your code!

## Introduction
ScrollStackController is a class you can use to create complex layouts using scrollable `UIStackView` but where each row is handled by a separate `UIViewController`; this allows you to keep a great separation of concerns.

You can think of it as `UITableView` but with several differences:

- **Each row is a different `UIViewController` you can manage independently**: no more massimove controllers, a much cleaner layout.
- **Powered by AutoLayout since the beginning**; it uses a combination of UIScrollView + UIStackView to offer an animation friendly controller ideal for fixed and dynamic row sizing.
- **You don't need to struggle yourself with view recycling**: suppose you have a layout composed by several different screens. There is no need of view recycling but it cause a more difficult managment of the layout. With a simpler and safer APIs set `ScrollStackView` is the ideal way to implement such layouts.
